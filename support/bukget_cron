# This is the schedule that bukget should be updating on.  These times are
# based on US Central time, so feel free to adjust as needed.  Generations
# on the grandparent bukget.org are performed every 6 hours at half past the
# hour.  For children, you will want to wait approx 10min to allow the
# generation to happen before pulling it down to get the latest build.
