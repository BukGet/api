# This is the schedule that bukget should be updating on.  These times are
# based on US Central time, so feel free to adjust as needed.  Generations
# on the grandparent bukget.org are performed every 6 hours at half past the
# hour.  Children can run the update as often as they like as nothing will
# happen unless the generation id on the parent is different than the child.
