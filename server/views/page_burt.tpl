<h2>BuRT, the BukGet Repository Tool</h2>
<p>
  Burt is a simple command-line tool designed to make generating json
  dictionaries for your plugin simple, painless, and easy.  BuRT can work
  in both interactively or non-interactively depending on your needs and
  has been designed to be able to be inserted into a batch or shell script
  if needed.  There is also the ability to pull the relevant information
  out of the plugin's plugin.yml file and use that to pre-populate some
  fields if needed.  While BuRT is not drag-n-drop, the aim is to make
  it both simple and flexible depending on your needs.
